                According to the Sedition Committee’s recommendations, which were led by Sir Sidney Rowlatt, this law was approved by him. Despite the entire opposition of the Indian members, this legislation was quickly passed in the Imperial Legislative Council. It granted the government broad authority to prohibit political activity and authorized the two-year imprisonment of political prisoners without charge or trial. 
                <br/>
                This Rowlatt Act is also known as Black law by the Indians. The Rowlatt Act inspired Gandhi and other nationalists to fight back against the British government. Gandhi founded the Rowlatt Satyagraha Sabha in February 1919, whose members committed to oppose the Act and risk judicial arrest and punishment. 
                <br/>
                This satyagraha seeks to prevent the rising anger in India by removing the oppressive clauses of the Defense of India Act (1915), which was passed during a period of war. The nationalist movement, whether it was led by moderates or extremists, had limited its conflict to agitation. The only political activity the nationalists were aware of was mass gatherings and protests, refusal to work with the government, boycotts of foreign goods and higher education institutions, and occasional acts of terrorism. The movement was instantly raised to a new level by satyagraha.
